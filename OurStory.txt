The Hip Hippocampi were not a fan of winter. Especially winter in Toronto. They decided one day instead that this would be the year that they would go on the most awesome vacation ever. They would pack their bags, put in their two-weeks notices, and head to the warmest place they could find on the surface of the Earth. Luckily, the Hip Hippocampi were pro-researchers; they Googled the warmest places on Earth and systematically decided on the pros and cons of each location. They compared weather data, ran analyses on the risk of winter ever hitting these locations, and consulted with environmental experts. Unluckily, none of them considered the correlation of tropical weather and...INSECTS! This is the story of how the Hip Hippocampi, a naive group of summer-seekers, were transformed into a DEET-repellent wearing, bug-evading super team.


Ariana's morning routine consisted of bathing in DEET and then slipping into her free-standing, pop-up mosquito net. Although thankful that she was safe from the hoard of insects that buzzed within every vacuole of their living quarters, this was not the kind of vacation she had imagined. She opened her novel, ready to enjoy what was perhaps the single gratifying part of the trip -- leisure reading -- only to find that the humidity had ruined the poor book quite thoroughly. She set the novel down and sighed. No, this was not the kind of vacation she had imagined at all.
